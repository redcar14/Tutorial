  </head>
    <p> I decided to make this website dedicated to my favorite kind of video game, Mario Kart. and to show what its all about. I adore many types of game series' like Super Smash Bros or Splatoon but my reason for making Mario Kart number one is because my first video game was Mario Kart Wii for the Wii. Ever since the day I got that game,
      it made me realize, I was in love with it. It was really hard to put down and I would always look forward to playing afterschool back in elementary.
      Today I still love it, and nothing will make my desicion change on it being the best game series to date.
      Thats why, I'm ging to show you why I love this game so much. <p>

There are 8 cups in Mario Kart you must take on to complete the game and four different speed classes. 50cc's, 100cc's, 150cc's, and Mirror. For the cups,theres the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, the Special Cup, the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and finally, the Lightning Cup.
  However, in the first few Mario Karts 3 Mario Kart games, there wasn't any Mirror mode.
