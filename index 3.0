  <h1> All About Driving </h1>

  <p>In order to win, you need to know what do do when your driving. The most essential thing you must know when playing this game is how to make the kart go and how to make it turn. Making the kart go and turn are pretty easy
    but there is somehing more difficult when it comes to turning. Thats learning how to drift. Its going to make a little while to get used to but in the end, it will
    seem like a piece of cake. Basically, you press the ZR button on the Wii U gamepad while using the control stick to drift in the direction you want. If you keep drifting, you'll eventually get blue sparks on your tires. If that goes on, you'll be able to get orange sparks. Heres a chart to help you understand the button inputs for Mario Kart 8.

<h1>Secrets to Mastering this Game</h1>

<p> If you think you have what it takes to be a professional in this game, brace yourself. Like I said at the beginning, there is more than you think. The first thing we are going to talk about in
  is fire hopping. Fire hopping is just one of the techniques that any pro would know in this game. When you fire hop, you need to make sure that you have a orange spark when you drift for the big boost. When you get the boost, press the ZR button rapidly and when you do that, make sure you move the control stick from one side to the other quickly too.
  Hm? Why should you want to do this? Well, because not only will it make your boost faster, it will also last longer too. Its hard to pull off but with practice, anyone can get it. An example of fire hopping would be this...

  <p> Another pro tip I wanna share is how to demon slide. I'm not really good at it so I can't pull it off that well. What you do is, right after a fire hop and your driving on a straight line, sort of do what you did with the fire hop but without the boost. This one is hard! I'm expert and I've been trying to learn this technique for 5-6 months. Man... Anyways, heres what demon sliding would look like in the game.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
