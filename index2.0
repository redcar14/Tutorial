  <h1 style="color : red"> History of Mario Kart</h1>

<p> Mario Kart has a pretty long history. It made its debut in 1992 in Japan and U.S. and in 1993 in Europe as Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System or SNES for short. Since its release, it sold over 9 million copies, making it the 3rd
best selling game on the SNES. Of course they would have to make a better Mario Kart, so...in 1996, Super Mario 64 came out for the Nintendo 64. This Mario Kart game however is the one that made the new ones how they are now. You see, because the Nintendo 64 was able to hold a lot of power, it was capable of substaining 3D graphics.
Later on a whole bunch of other Mario Kart games came out: Mario Kart Double Dash, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart Wii,
Mario Kart 7, and the latest one in the series and my personal favorite, Mario Kart 8. Heres what all the games are like if you didn't know.</p>

<h1 style="color : red"> The Characters</h1>
<p> There are many types of characters in every Mario Kart game. From classics like Mario and Luigi to new characters you've never seen before. If I had to pick a favorite character selection from any Mario Kart game, it would have to be Wii.
  In my opinion, I thought it had the best variety in the whole game. Mario Kart 8's character selection is pretty good but not as good as MKWii. Mostly because the new characters, the Koopalings, take up all the space
  in the roster thus making some favorable characters like Dry Bones, Bowser Jr., or King Boo to disappear. Heres a comparrison between the two.</p>
