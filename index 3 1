  <h1 style="color : red"> Facts about Mario Kart! (Woohoo, boring! :D )</h1>
  <li>Mario Kart 7 for the Nintendo 3DS introduced gliding in the air and going underwater.
  <li>Mario Kart 8 introduced zero gravity racing. Sort of like another racing series I know...but what?
  <li>Again, Mario Kart 8 was the first in the series, to use live orchestrated music.
  <li>The best selling Mario Kart game was Mario Kart Wii with a whopping 35 million copies sold.
  <li>In the Japanese release of Super Mario Kart, if Bowser or Peach won 1st place, they would chug a bottle of champaign.
     Of course, this would have to be edited out for the western releases mainly becuase they were drinking and it would be innapropriate for kids. In the western releases, instead of drinking the champaign,
     Bowser and peach would just thow the bottle up and down.
  <li>Mario Kart got 3 spin-off games for arcade machines. They were Mario Kart Arcade GP, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2, and Mario Kart Arcade GP DX.
  <li>The three arcade Mario Karts would let you have the option to play as Pac-Man. You could'nt play as him in the original games to the series.
  <li>In DLC for Mario Kart 8, you can play as Link from The Legend of Zelda.
  </li>
  <p>These are some photographs about the facts I just went over.</p>
